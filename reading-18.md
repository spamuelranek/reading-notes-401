## We are going get in to Bitcoin?
# NO, THIS... Just no

- Basics
  - Encryption
    - moddifing an existing structure so that it can not be easily interpreted
  - Decryption
    - taking the encrypted structure and performing another modification to bring it back to the original state
  - Cracking
    - the act of trying to decipher a encrypted structure with out knowing the transformation that took to encrypt the structure in the first place
- Symmetric Encrpytion
  - same modification to encrypt as to decrypt
- Public Key Encryption
  - Key generation
    - gernerates a public key and private key
  - Key exchange
    - both ends send their public key. The public key allow the sender to encrypt the structure in a way that only the reciever should be able to decode and vis versa
