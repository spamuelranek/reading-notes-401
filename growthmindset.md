## [Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)

- Speaks to the idea that to get better, it takes a choice. Just doing the same problem set and working with in the same problem domain does not invcrease your skills. You may get better at the things you do but it will not allow for the novel an fun\interesting growth that helps change things.

## [Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)

- The Tyrannay of the now is an interesting idea. This is a process of learning. We are always in a process of learning. This experience we are undertaking is all about the yet. We are not working to just solve the problems today but to help setup the systems of thinking to succeed in the future. With the goal in the future means their is time to grow and learn.

## [Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)

- Grit is about having an idea of the future working to make that future a reality. Argument is made by Angela that Grit can be an outcome of a growth mindset. The ability to extrapolate into the future with the belief of change and growth. It is seeing a delayed reward not as a bad thing but as an even better tool for getting to that reward. If the reward is right here right now, there is only success or failure. If we remember that learning is a process and not an endpoint. A failure today is not a failure to get to the goal. It is simply a failure today, and a learning opportunity on the journey of learning.

## [Alain de Botton on Redefining Success](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)

- Success is defined by the individual that is defining it. It will look different to different people. This flows well from the other pieces. Those goals we are setting for ourselves and what success looks like needs to come from within otherwise we will not feel that sense of joy meeting our own goals. I can imagine it would be hard to meet the goals you put forth and to have grit and to keep a growth mindset through the whole endevor only to arrive at a destination that is the wrong one.

## [Emotional Intelligence](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/prep_work/emotional-intelligence-assessment.html)

- It highlighted that self-control is a point I am behind compared to the other aspects of emotional intelligence. I know it can be difficult for me to maintain composure in the moment. I often have to step away from an experience before I can engage proactively again. It is something I have been working on for some time. I know I also do not control my non-verbal communication as much as I could. I notice I respond with my body much louder than my words. Those responses are ususally tied to outdated and not the feelings I would like to to share. I see those as the most import things to work on going forward.

## [Bias Self-Assessment](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/prep_work/bias-assessment.html)

- It is a nice checklist to help start converstations. I see as incomplete as it does not have additional reading or descriptions it uses outside of the question. I still do not know what the four eays to act is. But it is a nice easy baramoter to have a jumping off point into the discussion of bias and how it can and does affect outcomes. For me it pointed to my actions as a leader has points for improvement. Making sure I create leadership opportunities other than myself is important. Also looking for feed-back from the group I am part of in order to better meet the team in all aspects.
