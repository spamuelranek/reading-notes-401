# Serverless Functions

## [What is Severless Computing?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless)
- You application does not have one designated server
- Instead it is a "cloud" of servver options that grow and shrink automatically as more resources are required
### Serverless and Function as a Service (FaaS)
- Faas is a subset of serverless
  - this is a design where code is only run in response to events or requests.
### Pros and Cons
- Pros
  - Allows developers to focus on the front-end functionality
  - Only pay for use
  - Work in the languages you want
  - Simplifies development operations and deployment
  - Some operations require powerful processing and cloud computing might be the cost-effective means
  - can aggregate meta data much easier
- Cons
 - May not be the best solution for long-term stable demand use
 - Sometimes it takes a bit to spin up the resources to meet demand
 - It can be hard to uncover bugs with the even more distributed system
 - It may make it harder to switch which vendor you use for serverless funtionality due to the specilization of your own code inorder to you the specific vendor
